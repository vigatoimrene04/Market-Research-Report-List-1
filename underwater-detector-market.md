<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Underwater Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>"Pulse Induction Metal Detectors (PI)"</li><li>"Very Low Frequency Metal Detectors (VLF)"</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the underwater detector market, Pulse Induction (PI) and Very Low Frequency (VLF) metal detectors serve distinct purposes. PI detectors are known for their ability to detect metallic objects at greater depths and in mineralized waters, as they transmit strong pulses and are less affected by ground mineralization. In contrast, VLF detectors operate at lower frequencies, providing more sensitivity to smaller targets, making them suitable for shallow water use where discrimination between metals is crucial.</p></p>
