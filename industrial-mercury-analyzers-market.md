<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Mercury Analyzers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cold Vapor Atomic Absorption</li><li>Cold Atomic Fluorescence</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Industrial Mercury Analyzers market offers two primary technologies: Cold Vapor Atomic Absorption (CVAA) and Cold Atomic Fluorescence (CAF). CVAA detects mercury by converting it into a vaporized form, which is then analyzed using light absorption techniques. It is highly sensitive and widely used in environmental monitoring. CAF, on the other hand, utilizes fluorescence emitted by mercury vapor when excited by a light source, providing exceptional sensitivity and specificity. Both methods are crucial for accurate mercury detection in industrial applications.</p></p>
