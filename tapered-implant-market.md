<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tapered Implant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Root-form Dental Implants</li><li>Plate-form Dental Implants</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The tapered implant market consists of two main types: root-form dental implants and plate-form dental implants. Root-form dental implants mimic the shape of natural tooth roots, providing stability and promoting osseointegration with the jawbone, making them the most common type used in modern dentistry. Plate-form dental implants, on the other hand, feature a flat shape designed for areas with limited bone width, offering an alternative for patients with insufficient bone structure. Both types are essential in dental restoration and rehabilitation.</p></p>
